# CU2Platinums

Adds platinum berries to the lobbies of collabs that use CollabUtils2
Some mods, have preset spawn positions for the platinum including:
- Strawberry Jam Collab 2024
- Secret Santa Collab 2024
- Spring Collab 2020
- Beginner Collab

For other mods you can use the button in the mod settings to set the spawn position manually (also works for mods with a preset)
You can also add presets to the mod directly by making a pull request, or opening an issue on this [Github repo](https://github.com/samgcode/CU2Platinums)
